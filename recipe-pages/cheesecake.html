    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>sOMEtimes, your girlfriend made a big cheese cake the other day and
        it's just sitting in the fridge. If yoiu get hungry you can just go
        in the fridge and eat a piece of the cheesecake and you don't even 
        have to cook anything!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of cream cheese for sure</li>
        <li>Some eggs</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>I think you mix up all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Maybe bake the graham cracker crust first?</li>
            <li>There was something about a water bath that sounded
                complicated to me. Idk, just ask your girlfriend
                what she did.
            </li>
            <li>Once it is done and chilled in the fridge you can 
                grab a piece and eat it. ðŸ˜‹
            </li>
        </ol>
